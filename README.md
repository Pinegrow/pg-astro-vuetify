### 1. Clone to local

[Create a repo from this template on GitHub](https://github.com/pinegrow/pg-astro/generate).

(or)

If you prefer to do it manually with the cleaner git history

```bash
npx giget@latest gh:pinegrow/pg-astro my-astro-app #project-name
cd my-astro-app
npm install #or use pnpm
```

(or)

If you prefer a blank template (a single empty home page) instead,

```bash
npx giget@latest gh:pinegrow/pg-astro#blank my-astro-app #project-name
cd my-astro-app
npm install #or use pnpm
```

## 2. Open in Vue Designer

Open your project in Vue Designer and follow the instructions displayed in the Config Panel (that should pop out automatically). Config Panel ⚙️ displays the key packages and the various links to their individual ecosystems and communities.

## Usage

### Start your development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Build

```bash
npm run build # MPA SSG (islands architecture)
```

### Analyze

```bash
npm run build # open stats.html to analyze bundle sizes
```

### Preview

npm run now # build & preview
